# Eye-Tracker
The eyes tracks the cursor across the screen.

# Summary
This is an animation of two eyes that looks as if they are tracking the users cursor on the computer screen.

# Future Improvments
To add to this project, I would be fun to add a blinking feature to the eyes to make them appear more real. Also, a featuer could be added wher if you click on the eyes themselves, they squint as if you "poked" the eye.

# Run Roadmap
